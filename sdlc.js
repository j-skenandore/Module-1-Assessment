// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Testing & Integration
// Implementation
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
let planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

let analysisOfRequirements = "This is where the developers figure what will the app do, how will it do it, and what resources will it use to complete those tasks"

let design = "The design phase models the way the application will work using different forms of framework. This would also be the stage where a prototype might be created"

let testingAndIntegration = "During this stage you are finalizing the product that you plan on releasing. It is important to test all of the features in a controlled environment to ensure that all features work together seamlessly"

let implementation = "This is where the app is deployed and becomes available for others to use it."

let maintain = "It is important to update and maintain the app to make sure it continues to be user friendly and relevant in the upcoming technological climates."
